# Ionic optimizer
A small hook for ionic ~1.2 application, that grabs sources you use and minifies them into small bundle.
Influenced by [cordova-uglify](https://github.com/rossmartin/cordova-uglify)

## Install
```
npm install ionic-optimizer --save-dev
```

## Limitations
As this hook is in stage of deep development, there's no flexible customisation available right now. But is on the way.
